MySICPSolutions
===============

If you dont know what Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is or why you shoud read it, I suggest  
you reading this article - http://hackerretreat.com/why-how-start-sicp/  
  
Even though there are many solutions to SICP exercises, I decided to publish my own solutions. Not only  
because it can be interesting to see more than one or two solutions, but also because its kinda motivating  
and maybe it will help me to finish the work i started.
